#### Who are you?
Jackie Parker

#### As best you can, describe the field or industry you can see yourself working in as a technical writer.
I see me working/volunteering in the non-profit arena. Creating documentation of their processes and grant writing.

#### What genres of documents/texts do technical writers in this field produce? What do these look like?Locate and share, if possible, some samples or examples of this genre. (If you're unclear on the term genre -- no worries. Look it up and we'll discuss it.)
I see myself writing instructions, checklists, and how-to manuals and reasons why something is worthy of funding.

#### What genre of technical writing do you have sense you might want to practice explore? If different from above, what do these look like? Locate and share, if possible, some samples or examples of this genre.
I like step by step instructions, how to's and checklists.

#### What sorts of research tend to be associated with these genres? At this point, do you know the difference between quantitative and qualitative research? If not, no worries -- look it up.
Locating the subject matter experts to obtain the process and locating grants that fit the non-profit to be applied for.

#### Another way to approach this project is to think situationally. What situations do technical writers in your desired field tend to be responding to? How might we replicate this situation in the context of our class?
Documenting the duties of positions and creating documentation so that anyone with the right skills can step in and perform the duties adequately. We could replicate this situation in class by documenting what is expected of students.

#### Beyond your desired field or industry, what situtaions -- professional, academic, even personal -- are you currently involved in that might need the work of a technical writer? For example, maybe your job doesn't have an employee manual, but really is in need of one. Or, maybe there is a manual but its 25 years old.
Currently I am a student and create checklists to ensure that all requirements are met on time. I also share a small business with my husband buying and selling antiques and collectables.

#### Given your responses to the above prompts -- what do you think? what are some possibilities for projects?
Create a brochure/booklet that explores how and where someone could locate items for resell and how to start doing this for fun and profit.
